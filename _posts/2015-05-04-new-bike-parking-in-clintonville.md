One of the major obstacles to a more bike-infused lifestyle is a lack of designated parking near
restaurants, stores, salons, and other favorite businesses. Leaving your bike chained to a parking
meter, tree, or fence is risky (not to mention, unsightly).

Designated bike parking gives people a safe and convenient place to park their bike. Because bike racks
take up little space, people can ride right up to the front door and have a safe place to lock up their
bicycles. This encourages more people to bike which reduces traffic congestion and parking hassles for
people that arrive by car. Everyone benefits.

Clintonville Neighborhood Greenways is working with local businesses and the City of Columbus to add
more bike parking in Clintonville. We are sending volunteers to local businesses to show them how
easy it is to request a free bike rack from the city.

If you run a business in Clintonville and we haven't visited you yet, requesting a free bike rack
from the city is easy:

1.  <b>Call the City of Columbus (614)645-3111 and request a bicycle rack</b>. They will ask you for
    the address where you are requesting to have a rack installed.

2.  <b>Infrastructure Management will follow-up on your request</b>. Check your mail and phone messages for
    any possible follow-up questions.

3.  <b>Notify the owner of the property at the address where you are requesting a rack.</b> They may need to
    approve the request before Infrastructure Management can proceed with the installation.

4.  <b>Welcome customers on bikes to park in front of your business!</b>
