The City is planning to build a 75 yard shared use path on city parkland that will
connect Rathbone and Jeffrey Place. It's an important piece of the Clintonville Neighborhood
Greenways safe streets network (CNG). This connection has been in the CNG route since 2015,
when it was approved by the Clintonville Area Commission. It's been funded by the City
and has gone through several design phases with input from residents.

Despite thorough vetting and approvals, the City still needs to hear from people that
support this connector to ensure it's completed as planned.

## Beechwold Connector Park Improvements

The Beechwold Connector includes a complete renovation of the parkland that connects
Rathbone and Jeffrey Place. This includes removal of invasive plants and a new
landscaping plan with 109 native plantings, including

- 5 Eastern Red Cedars - which grow to 30-40 ft
- 13 American Hollies - which grow to 13-25 ft
- Dogwoods - which grow at least 15ft
- Gentsch White Hemlocks
- Cranberry Bushes
- Purple Chokeberries

Not only are we gaining an important neighborhood connection, we are also getting a
newly renovated park in the heart of Old Beechwold and Delawanda.

# What is the Beechwold Connector?

The Beechwold Connector is a key link in a larger, neighborhood-wide safe streets
network called the [Clintonville Neighborhood Greenways](/). The Connector is located
between Rathbone and Jeffery Place
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1hsT6lhfuUlh2AUk1Lp9lDTgUFNs&ll=40.06238694099186%2C-83.02532179556246&z=17" target="_blank">(see map)</a>.

An important element of any safe street network is connecting people to destinations.
The Beechwold Connector is particularly beneficial in this regard. It's similar to
<a href='{% post_url 2022-02-20-shared-use-paths-connect-neighborhoods-throughout-columbus %}'>other connectors throughout the city</a> that allow bike and pedestrian traffic to travel through neighborhoods instead
of along more heavily trafficked roadways.

- The Beechwold Connector connects people to Graceland Shopping Center.

- The Beechwold Connector connects children to schools including Red Oak Community School,
OLP Catholic School, Indian Springs Elementary, Bishop Watterson, and Whetstone High School.

- The Beechwold Connector connects people to the Olentangy Trail via the Henderson Rd access point.

- The Beechwold Connector connects people to the athletic fields, nature preserve, and sledding hill
at Kenny Park.

- The Beechwold Connector connects people to friends and family. Children in Beechwold ride
their bikes to friend's houses and to see family and grandparents.

# Frequently Asked Questions

Below are some common questions about the Beechwold Connector. See our
[FAQ page](/faq.html) for more.

<div class="question">
  Will the Connector increase the number of people biking in Old Beechwold?
</div>
<div class="answer">
  The Beechwold Connector is on an existing, city-owned, parcel that's
  already well known and widely used by residents. Based on other
  areas of the Clintonville Neighborhood Greenways, including nearby corridors
  like Weisheimer, we don't expect a significant change in the number of people
  riding bikes in Old Beechwold.

</figure>

<div class="question">
  Streets in Old Beechwold are narrow and winding. Will more people on bikes increase
  the danger for other road users?
</div>
<div class="answer">
  There are many streets in Clintonville that are just as narrow as the streets in
  Old Beechwold. If there's room for cars, there's certainly room for bikes. The
  winding nature of the streets actually helps because it slows people down and makes
  them more attentive.<br>
  <br>
  People on bikes are not a danger to other road users.
  The Olentangy Trail and Alum Creek Trail are both narrower and windier than roads
  in Old Beechwold. These corridors serve significantly more traffic than Old Beechwold
  without any problems.

</figure>

<div class="question">
  Is it possible to route this connector along High St?
</div>
<div class="answer">
  There are numerous challenges that prevent a safe connection from being made
  along High Street. Historic pillars, a bus stop, and multiple mature trees
  would need to be moved / removed to provide adequate width for an ADA-compliant
  shared use path.<br>
  <br>
  Even if sufficient room were achieved, there are numerous conflict points where
  turning cars would pose a risk to people on bikes due to the high level of traffic
  and speeds on High St.

</figure>

<div class="question">
  I don't have a bike. Does this connector help me?
</div>
<div class="answer">
  Absolutely! Based on who's using it now, the connector will be used more
  often by families with strollers and wagons and people walking dogs than
  people on bikes.

</figure>

<div class="question">
  The connector is fine the way it is. Why are we improving it?
</div>
<div class="answer">
  While a connection does exist within the easement, it's currently an unimproved muddy path.
  The new paved connection will be ADA-compliant, making it perfect for people with mobility
  challenges, families in the neighborhood with strollers and wagons, as well as people on bikes.

</figure>

<div class="question">
  Who owns the land where the Beechwold Connector will be constructed?
</div>
<div class="answer">
  The Connector will be constructed on city parkland that's been designated
  since Old Beechwold was first laid out in 1915. The parkland was always
  intended to connect to the outside (see map below). The map also shows that
  Milton was originally intended to connect the neighborhood to Rathbone from
  Jeffrey Place.

</div>

<div class="question">
  Are there other places in Columbus with similar connectors?
</div>
<div class="answer">
  Shared use paths are used throughout Columbus to connect neighborhoods to each other
  and to nearby trail systems. <a href='{% post_url 2022-02-20-shared-use-paths-connect-neighborhoods-throughout-columbus %}'>Read our story about similar connectors in Columbus.</a>

</figure>

<div class="question">
  What's the harm in changing our minds on the Connector?
</div>
<div class="answer">
  The safe-streets network, which includes the Beechwold Connector, was part of a
  2015 <a target='_blank' href='https://www.columbus.gov/planning/uirf/'>Urban Infrastructure Recovery Fund</a>
  (UIRF) package requested by the Clintonville Area Commission on behalf of the neighborhood.
  It has undergone numerous back-and-forth steps with reviews at both the City and the
  CAC. It has been funded, designed, and scheduled for construction (see <a href='#history'>history</a> below).<br>
  <br>
  If, after all that, we change our minds and say "on second thought, we don't actually want
  this", it undermines our credibility and impacts our ability to get help from the City on
  future projects, regardless of what they are.

# <a name="history"></a> History

- The Beechwold Connector is part of a larger, neighborhood-wide safe streets network that
  was identified as a priority in the 2015 Clintonville Area Commission Planning and Development
  Committee's mobility plan.

- [This website](/), describing the project, was launched
  in 2015 and widely promoted. The Beechwold Connector has been on the route map since
  the site launched in 2015.

- In June 2015 the neighborhood-wide safe streets network (called the Clintonville Bikeway)
  was discussed & approved by the Clintonville Area Commission as part of a larger
  <a target='_blank' href='https://www.columbus.gov/planning/uirf/'>Urban Infrastructure Recovery Fund</a>
  package. This UIRF package, including the bike network was also vetted and approved
  by the City of Columbus. The full route map was available at that time and was examined
  and approved by all CAC commissioners and city officials involved.

- In September 2017 The CAC received an additional update on all UIRF projects, including
  the Clintonville Bikeway network. Once again, all CAC members had a chance to review the route
  map and design. The CAC re-affirmed their approval at that time.

- There were articles about the Clintonville bike network in both
  <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20150825074636/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/08/24/bike-n-hike-safety.html' target="_blank">The Columbus Dispatch</a> and
  <a href='http://www.columbusunderground.com/clintonville-greenways-idea-moving-forward-bw1' target="_blank">Columbus Underground</a>.
  The Dispatch article included the route map showing the Beechwold Connector.
