Phase 1 of the Clintonville Neighborhood Greenways has been funded as part of the 2015 UIRF
package approved by the City of Columbus and The Clintonville Area Commission. With the funding
in place, we are now working on the specific design of what will be built.

This document outlines recommendations for phase 1 of the Clintonville Neighborhood Greenways.
These recommendations are based on months of researching routes, daily riding through the
neighborhood, and analysis of other citys' neighborhood greenway projects.

##General Design Guidelines

Neighborhood greenways consist of the following elements:

-   **A distinctive look** so that all road users are aware of the neighborhood greenway.
    People driving are alerted that the street is prioritized for biking and walking.
-   **Treatments to reduce vehicle speed and volume as needed.** The goal is to keep 85th
    percentile speed under 25mph and ADT under 1000 cars per day.
-   **Improved treatments at arterials** to help people biking and walking cross more easily.
-   **Free-flow travel for people biking and walking** by assigning the right-of-way to the
    neighborhood greenway at intersections wherever possible.
-   **Way-finding signs** guiding people along the route and letting people know what is
    nearby, for example parks, schools, and local businesses.
  
##Strategy

Something about measuring stress metrics and only doing treatments when needed.

## Other cities' design guidelines

Berkeley CA and Portland OR both have successful neighborhood greenway networks. The success
of their networks makes these cities good models to follow.
