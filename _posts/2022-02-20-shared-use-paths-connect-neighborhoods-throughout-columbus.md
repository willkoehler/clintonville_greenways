A component of the Clintonville Neighborhood Greenway is a shared use path that connects
Rathbone Ave to Jeffrey Place. The path will be constructed on city parkland. Here's a
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1hsT6lhfuUlh2AUk1Lp9lDTgUFNs&ll=40.06238694099186%2C-83.02532179556246&z=17" target="_blank">map</a> of the location and here's a
<a href="/images/connectors/rathbone-jeffrey-place-connector.pdf" target="_blank">drawing</a>
of what it will look like.

While this may seem unusual, shared use paths are used throughout Columbus to connect
neighborhoods to each other and to nearby trail systems. These connections make the neighborhoods
<a href="http://www.brucefreemanrailtrail.org/pdf/LA-Metro-Bike-paths-safety-property-values.pdf" target="_blank">
safer and more desireable to live in.
</a>

The neighborhoods are safer because there are more "eyes on the street". More
people that live in the neighborhood are out and about and are more likely to see
and report suspicious activity. The neighborhoods are more desireable because people
have more options to move safely around their community. They have more "random
encounters" with other people, resulting in increased feelings of belonging and
wellbeing.
