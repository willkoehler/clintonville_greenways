<b>This should be short and simple:</b>

-   Explain the benefits of bike parking.
-   Explain how we're working with the city and local businesses to add more bike parking.
-   Maybe a story? After talking with Alex, Clintonville Outfitters requested a bike rack from the city
    they're already installed.
-   Include instructions for requesting a bike rack from the city?

<b>Also TODO:</b>

-   Think of a better title.
-   Create a subtitle.
-   Write an excerpt for the home page.
