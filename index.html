      <h2>A network of streets for people</h2>

      <p>
        Clintonville Neighborhood Greenways are a network of streets where people biking and walking are given
        priority. They create safe routes to bike and walk around the neighborhood without using High Street
        or Indianola. This encourages more people to bike and walk to destinations in the neighborhood.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neighborhood Greenways are designed to feel safe for all ages and abilities. They appeal to a large
        cross-section of people in the neighborhood, sometimes referred to as the “bike curious”, who would
        bike and walk more if they felt safe on the roads.
      </p>

      <h2>Greenways benefit the whole neighborhood</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><b>A quieter, more pleasant street environment</b> that improves safety for everyone.</li>
        <li>
          <b>A stronger sense of community and neighborhood identity.</b> With more people biking and
          walking, there are more opportunities for random encounters where neighbors can meet and interact.
          This makes the neighborhood safer and more pleasant for everyone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Increased patronage of local businesses.</b> People biking and walking visit local businesses
          more frequently and spend more money over time than people driving.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>More "eyes on the street"</b> and a slower street environment result in more awareness
          of the neighborhood and reduced crime.
        </li>
      </ul>
