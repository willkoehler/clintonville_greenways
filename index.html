  Let's build a network of safe streets in Clintonville modeled after Portland's Neighborhood Greenways.

  <p>
    When I encourage friends and neighbors to bike in Clintonville, by far the biggest push back
    I get is "I don't feel safe riding on the road". We are not going to have a significant number
    of families biking in Clintonville until they have safe routes to ride on.
  </P>

  <p>
    The Olentangy trail is great. But it's not practical for short trips within Clintonville. We need a
    network of safe neighborhood roads that connect Clintonville. This will make it easy for families
    to get around by bike, reduce traffic and parking problems, and increase patronage of neighborhood
    businesses.

  <p>
    Neighborhood Greenways don't just benefit cyclists, they create a slower and quieter street
    environment that improves safety everyone including pedestrians and children playing in front
    yards. Benefits include:
    <ul>
      <li>A quieter, more pleasant environment for walking or sitting.</li>
      <li>Easier street crossings because of reduced traffic volume and speed.</li>
      <li>Safer crossing of major streets where new traffic control devices are installed.</li>
      <li>Improved neighborhood identity and coherence.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Design Guidelines</h2>

  <p>
    Berkeley California and Portland Oregon both have successful neighborhood greenway networks. The success
    of their networks makes these cities good models to follow.
