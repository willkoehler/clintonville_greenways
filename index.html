  <h1>
    Let's build a network of safe streets in Clintonville - like Portland's Neighborhood Greenways.
  </h1>
  
  <p>
    When I encourage friends and neighbors to bike in Clintonville, by far the biggest push back
    I get is "I don't feel safe riding on the road". We are not going to have a significant number
    of families biking in Clintonville until they have safe routes to ride on.

  <h1>
    Greenways benefit the whole neighborhood
  </h1>

  <p>
    Neighborhood Greenways don't just benefit cyclists, they create a slower and quieter street
    environment that improves safety for everyone, including pedestrians and children playing in
    front yards.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Benefits include:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>A quieter, more pleasant environment for walking or sitting.</li>
    <li>Easier street crossings because of reduced traffic volume and speed.</li>
    <li>Safer crossing of major streets where new traffic control devices are installed.</li>
    <li>Improved neighborhood identity and coherence.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>
    The Olentangy Trail is great, but we need a network.
  </h1>

  <p>
    The Olentangy trail is great, but it's not practical for short trips within Clintonville.
    We need a network of safe roads that connect the neighborhood. This will make it easy for
    families to get around by bike, reduce traffic and parking problems, and increase patronage of
    local businesses.
  </p>


  <h1>
    Here's a proposal to start the discussion
  </h1>
  
  <p>
    Add 8 miles of designated greenway routes. Add speed bumps to slow traffic. Add 
    <a href='images/bike-box.jpg'>bike boxes</a> at busy crossings. Reconfigure stop signs to give
    greenways the right of way. Add diverters, such as
    <a href='images/choker-entrance-example1-for-map.jpg'>choker entrances</a> to reduce traffic volume
    on greenways to under 1000 cars/day. Add bike lanes where it's not practical to limit traffic volume.
  </p>

    We can learn from other city design guidelines.
  </h1>

  <div class='section'>
    <p>
      Berkeley California and Portland Oregon both have successful neighborhood greenway networks. The success
      of their networks makes these cities good models to follow.
