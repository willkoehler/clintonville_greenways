    Let's build a network of safe streets in Clintonville - like Portland's Neighborhood Greenways.
  </h1>
  
  <p>
    Imagine traveling along a network of streets designed first for children and adults
    who are walking and biking. Streets where people are alert when they drive, and children
    safely play on scooters and bikes. Imagine these streets are close to where you live and
    connect you to the places you want to go. These are Clintonville neighborhood greenways.

  <h1>
    Greenways benefit the whole neighborhood
  </h1>

  <p>
    Neighborhood Greenways create a slower and quieter street environment that improves safety
    for everyone, including pedestrians and children playing in front yards.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Benefits include:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>A quieter, more pleasant environment for walking or sitting.</li>
    <li>Easier street crossings because of reduced traffic volume and speed.</li>
    <li>Safer crossing of major streets where new traffic control devices are installed.</li>
    <li>Improved neighborhood identity and coherence.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>
    The Olentangy Trail is great, but we need a network.
  </h1>

  <p>
    The Olentangy trail is great, but it's not practical for short trips within Clintonville.
    We need a network of safe roads that connect the neighborhood. This will make it easy for
    families to get around biking and walking, reduce traffic and parking problems, and increase
    patronage of local businesses.
  </p>


  <h1>
    Here's a proposal to start the discussion
  </h1>
  
  <p>
    Create 8 miles of designated greenway routes, connecting 8 schools, Whetstone park, the library,
    restaurants, and shopping. Add <a href='images/bike-box.jpg'>bike boxes</a> at busy crossings.
    Turn some stop signs to give greenways the right of way. Discourage cut-through traffic with
    speed bumps and traffic diverters, such as <a href='images/choker-entrance-example1-for-map.jpg'>choker entrances</a>.
    Add bike lanes, if needed on roads with higher traffic volume.
  </p>

    We can learn from other city design guidelines.

  <div class='section'>
    <p>
      Berkeley California and Portland Oregon both have successful neighborhood greenway networks. The success
      of their networks makes these cities good models to follow.
