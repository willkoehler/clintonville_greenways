      <div class='question'>
        How do Clintonville Neighborhood Greenways make it safer for people to bike and walk in the
        neighborhood?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        Safety is created through a combination of infrastructure and cooperation between all road users.
        By using streets with low traffic speed and volume, adding treatments as needed to keep traffic
        speed and volume low, and raising awareness through signs, branding, public education, and road
        markings, Neighborhood Greenways create a slow street environment that is safe for everyone.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        What neighborhood destinations do Clintonville Neighborhood Greenways connect to?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Schools:</b> Indianola K-8, Clinton Elementary, Calumet Christian, Whetstone High School,
            School for Young Children, Our Lady of Peace, Indian Springs Elementary, Dominion Middle
            School, Colerain Elementary, Columbus North International.
          </li>
          <li><b>Whetstone Complex:</b> Library, Recreation Center, Park of Roses, soccer and ball fields</li>
          <li><b>High Street shopping and restaurants</b></li>
          <li><b>Clintonville Farmers Market</b></li>
          <li><b>Multiple connection points to the Olentangy Trail</b></li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Isn't the Olentangy Trail enough?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        The Olentangy Trail is great, but it's not practical for short trips within Clintonville.
        We need a network of safe roads that connect all of Clintonville so people can bike and walk
        to nearby destinations.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Why do we want more people biking and walking in Clintonville?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        With more people biking and walking there are more opportunities for social encounters where
        neighbors can meet and interact. This makes the neighborhood safer and more pleasant for everyone.
        Giving people more transportation options also reduces traffic and parking problems, and increases
        patronage of local businesses.
      </div>

      <a id='funding'></a>
      <h2>Funding</h2>

      <div class='question'>
        How will this project be funded?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        The first phase of the Neighborhood Greenways project will be funded with Urban Infrastructure
        Renewal Funds (UIRF). These funds are allocated by the city for neighborhood improvements that
        have been identified and prioritized by residents of the neighborhood. This project (formerly
        called the "North South Bike Connector") was identified in the 2009 Clintonville Neighborhood
        Plan and approved by the City and Clintonville Area Commission.
      </div>

      <a id='regulations'></a>
      <h2>Road Regulations</h2>

      <div class='question'>
        Why should people biking and walking have priority on these streets?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        People biking and walking are the most vulnerable road users and they need to be given
        priority on neighborhood roads to ensure everyone's safety.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        My street is already safe. Why do we need to do anything?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        While some people feel safe on the streets as they are, many people, especially those
        with younger children, don't feel the roads are safe enough for biking and walking.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        How many people are going to be biking on my street?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        We don't anticipate any more bike traffic on Neighborhood Greenways than current
        volume of car traffic.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Will I still be able to drive on my street?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        The Neighborhood Greenways are a shared network of streets. You will always be able
        to drive on the streets. In later phases, traffic diverters may be used to discourage
        cut-through traffic.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Will the speed limit change on my street?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        There are no plans to change speed limits in Phase 1. Long-term, lowering the speed limit
        to 20mph on Neighborhood Greenways may be considered. This will not happen without
        community dialogue and would require a special exemption from the city.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Will I still be able to park on my street?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        There are no plans to limit parking on Neighborhood Greenways.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Will it be confusing for people to navigate the street with new rules and signs?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        There will be no new rules for people driving to follow. We anticipate way-finding
        signs to mark the route and sharrows to raise awareness of shared use roads.
      </div>

      <a id='safety'></a>
      <h2>Neighborhood Safety</h2>

      <div class='question'>
        Will the Neighborhood Greenways affect neighborhood safety?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        Because this is a network of streets within Clintonville, the Neighborhood Greenways
        will primarily be used by families that live in the neighborhood. By creating
        more "eyes on the street" and a slower street environment, neighborhood
        greenways result in more awareness and community connections that are shown to
        improve safety and reduce crime.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Will the Neighborhood Greenways be like the Milton Bike Boulevard?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        Milton is a through route with many types of people, including some that are riding fast
        to get a workout and not respecting the quiet nature of neighborhood streets. By contrast,
        The Neighborhood Greenways will primarily be used by families that live in the neighborhood
        who are riding to local destinations like restaurants, shopping, and parks.
