      <div class='question'>
        How does Clintonville Neighborhood Greenways make it safer for people to bike and walk in the
        neighborhood?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        Safety is created through both infrastructure and cooperation between all road users. By using
        streets with low traffic speed and volume, doing treatments as needed to keep traffic speed and
        volume low, and raising awareness through signs, branding, public education, and road markings,
        Neighborhood Greenways create a slow street environment that is safe for everyone.
      </div>
      
      <div class='question'>
        What neighborhood destinations does Clintonville Neighborhood Greenways connect to?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        8 Schools, Whetstone library, Whetstone recreation center, Whetstone Park of Roses soccer fields
        and ball fields, Clintonville farmers market, 6 churches, High Street shopping and restaurants.
        There are also multiple connection points to the Olentangy trail.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Isn't the Olentangy Trail enough?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        The Olentangy trail is great, but it's not practical for short trips within Clintonville.
        We need a network of safe roads that connect the neighborhood so people can bike and walk
        to nearby destinations.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Why do we want more people biking and walking in Clintonville?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        With more people biking and walking there are more opportunities for random encounters where
        neighbors can meet and interact. This makes the neighborhood safer and more pleasant for everyone.
        Giving people more transportation options also reduces traffic and parking problems, and increases
        patronage of local businesses.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        How will this be funded?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        The first phase of the neighborhood greenways project will be funded with Urban Infrastructure
        Renewal Funds (UIRF). These funds are allocated by the city for neighborhood improvements that
        have been identified and prioritized by residents of the neighborhood. This project (formerly
        called the "North South Bike Connector") was identified in the 2009 Clintonville Neighborhood
        Plan and approved by the City and Clintonville Area Commission.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        I don't want to bike or walk. How does this benefit me?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        Neighborhood greenways create a calmer and safer street environment that will benefit all
        Clintonville residents.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Why should people biking and walking have priority on these streets?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        People biking and walking are the most vulnerable road users, they need to be given
        priority on neighborhood roads to ensure everyone's safety.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        My street is already safe. Why do we need to do anything?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        While some people feel safe on the streets as they are, many people, especially those
        with younger children, don't feel the roads are safe enough for biking and walking.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        How many people are going to be biking on my street?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        We don't anticipate any more bike traffic on neighborhood greenways than current
        volume of car traffic.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Will I still be able to drive on my street?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        The neighborhood greenway is shared network of streets. There are no plans for
        any type of traffic restrictions in phase 1. Traffic diverters, to limit cut-through traffic,
        may be considered in later phases.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Will the speed limit change on my street?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        There are no plans to change speed limits in phase 1. Long-term, lowering the speed limit
        to 20mph on neighborhood greenways may be considered. This will not happen without
        community dialog and would require a special exemption from the city.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Will I still be able to park on my street?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        There are no plans to limit parking on neighborhood greenways.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Will it be confusing for people to navigate the street with new rules and signs?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        There will be no new rules for people driving to follow. We anticipate way-finding
        signs to mark the route and sharrows to raise awareness of shared use roads.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        I'm afraid that I'm going to hit a person biking or a person biking is going to hit me.
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        By raising awareness among all types of road users, neighborhood greenways are safer
        for everyone.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Will this invite strangers to come through my neighborhood?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        Because this is a network of streets within Clintonville, the neighborhood greenways
        will primarily be used by families that live in the neighborhood. Whether walking,
        riding bikes, or driving, they can be trusted to use the streets safely.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Will the Neighborhood Greenways be like the Milton Bike Boulevard?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        Milton is a through route with many types of people, including some that are riding fast
        to get a workout and not respecting the quiet nature of neighborhood streets. The neighborhood
        greenways will primarily be used by families that live in the neighborhood who are riding
        to local destinations like restaurants, shopping, and parks.
      </div>

      <div class='question'>
        Will this increase vandalism or crime by attracting more people to my street?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        By creating more "eyes on the street" and a slower street environment, neighborhood
        greenways result in more awareness and community connections that are shown to
        reduce crime and vandalism.
