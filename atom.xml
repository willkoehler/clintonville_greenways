    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The City is planning to build a 75 yard shared use path on city parkland that will
connect Rathbone and Jeffrey Place. It’s an important piece of the Clintonville Neighborhood
Greenways safe streets network (CNG). This connection has been in the CNG route since 2015,
when it was approved by the Clintonville Area Commission. It’s been funded by the City
and has gone through several design phases with input from residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite thorough vetting and approvals, the City still needs to hear from people that
support this connector to ensure it’s completed as planned.
Continue below to learn more. Or &lt;a href=&quot;#call-to-action&quot;&gt;skip down&lt;/a&gt; to see how you can help.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/beechwold-connector/beechwold-connector-render.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beechwold-connector-park-improvements&quot;&gt;Beechwold Connector Park Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Beechwold Connector includes a complete renovation of the parkland that connects
Rathbone and Jeffrey Place. This includes removal of invasive plants and a new
landscaping plan with 109 native plantings, including&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 Eastern Red Cedars - which grow to 30-40 ft&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;13 American Hollies - which grow to 13-25 ft&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dogwoods - which grow at least 15ft&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gentsch White Hemlocks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cranberry Bushes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Purple Chokeberries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only are we gaining an important neighborhood connection, we are also getting a
newly renovated park in the heart of Old Beechwold and Delawanda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-the-beechwold-connector&quot;&gt;What is the Beechwold Connector?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Beechwold Connector is a key link in a larger, neighborhood-wide safe streets
network called the &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Clintonville Neighborhood Greenways&lt;/a&gt;. The Connector is located
between Rathbone and Jeffery Place
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1hsT6lhfuUlh2AUk1Lp9lDTgUFNs&amp;amp;ll=40.06238694099186%2C-83.02532179556246&amp;amp;z=17&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(see map)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important element of any safe street network is connecting people to destinations.
The Beechwold Connector is particularly beneficial in this regard. It’s similar to
&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/20/shared-use-paths-connect-neighborhoods-throughout-columbus.html&quot;&gt;other connectors throughout the city&lt;/a&gt; that allow bike and pedestrian traffic to travel through neighborhoods instead
of along more heavily trafficked roadways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Beechwold Connector connects people to Graceland Shopping Center.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Beechwold Connector connects children to schools including Red Oak Community School,
OLP Catholic School, Indian Springs Elementary, Bishop Watterson, and Whetstone High School.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Beechwold Connector connects people to the Olentangy Trail via the Henderson Rd access point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Beechwold Connector connects people to the athletic fields, nature preserve, and sledding hill
at Kenny Park.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Beechwold Connector connects people to friends and family. Children in Beechwold ride
their bikes to friend’s houses and to see family and grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;frequently-asked-questions&quot;&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some common questions about the Beechwold Connector. See our
&lt;a href=&quot;/faq.html&quot;&gt;FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;
  Will the Connector increase the number of people biking in Old Beechwold?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;
  The Beechwold Connector is on an existing, city-owned, parcel that's
  already well known and widely used by residents. Based on other
  areas of the Clintonville Neighborhood Greenways, including nearby corridors
  like Weisheimer, we don't expect a significant change in the number of people
  riding bikes in Old Beechwold.
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/beechwold-connector/heading-out-with-friends-on-bikes.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;
  Streets in Old Beechwold are narrow and winding. Will more people on bikes increase
  the danger for other road users?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;
  There are many streets in Clintonville that are just as narrow as the streets in
  Old Beechwold. If there's room for cars, there's certainly room for bikes. The
  winding nature of the streets actually helps because it slows people down and makes
  them more attentive.&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  People on bikes are not a danger to other road users.
  The Olentangy Trail and Alum Creek Trail are both narrower and windier than roads
  in Old Beechwold. These corridors serve significantly more traffic than Old Beechwold
  without any problems.
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/beechwold-connector/family-biking-to-the-park.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;
  Is it possible to route this connector along High St?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;
  There are numerous challenges that prevent a safe connection from being made
  along High Street. Historic pillars, a bus stop, and multiple mature trees
  would need to be moved / removed to provide adequate width for an ADA-compliant
  shared use path.&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  Even if sufficient room were achieved, there are numerous conflict points where
  turning cars would pose a risk to people on bikes due to the high level of traffic
  and speeds on High St.
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/beechwold-connector/coming-home-from-church.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;
  I don't have a bike. Does this connector help me?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;
  Absolutely! Based on who's using it now, the connector will be used more
  often by families with strollers and wagons and people walking dogs than
  people on bikes.
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/beechwold-connector/evening-trip-to-kroger-with-the-family.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;
  The connector is fine the way it is. Why are we improving it?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;
  While a connection does exist within the easement, it's currently an unimproved muddy path.
  The new paved connection will be ADA-compliant, making it perfect for people with mobility
  challenges, families in the neighborhood with strollers and wagons, as well as people on bikes.
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/beechwold-connector/biking-home-from-kroger.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;
  Who owns the land where the Beechwold Connector will be constructed?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;
  The Connector will be constructed on city parkland that's been designated
  since Old Beechwold was first laid out in 1915. The parkland was always
  intended to connect to the outside (see map below). The map also shows that
  Milton was originally intended to connect the neighborhood to Rathbone from
  Jeffrey Place.

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;
  Are there other places in Columbus with similar connectors?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;
  Shared use paths are used throughout Columbus to connect neighborhoods to each other
  and to nearby trail systems. &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/20/shared-use-paths-connect-neighborhoods-throughout-columbus.html&quot;&gt;Read our story about similar connectors in Columbus.&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/beechwold-connector/boathouse-drive-neighborhood-connector.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;
  What's the harm in changing our minds on the Connector?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;
  The safe-streets network, which includes the Beechwold Connector, was part of a
  2015 &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.columbus.gov/planning/uirf/&quot;&gt;Urban Infrastructure Recovery Fund&lt;/a&gt;
  (UIRF) package requested by the Clintonville Area Commission on behalf of the neighborhood.
  It has undergone numerous back-and-forth steps with reviews at both the City and the
  CAC. It has been funded, designed, and scheduled for construction (see &lt;a href=&quot;#history&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; below).&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  If, after all that, we change our minds and say &quot;on second thought, we don't actually want
  this&quot;, it undermines our credibility and impacts our ability to get help from the City on
  future projects, regardless of what they are.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;-history&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; History&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Beechwold Connector is part of a larger, neighborhood-wide safe streets network that
was identified as a priority in the 2015 Clintonville Area Commission Planning and Development
Committee’s mobility plan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;This website&lt;/a&gt;, describing the project, was launched
in 2015 and widely promoted. The Beechwold Connector has been on the route map since
the site launched in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In June 2015 the neighborhood-wide safe streets network (called the Clintonville Bikeway)
was discussed &amp;amp; approved by the Clintonville Area Commission as part of a larger
&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.columbus.gov/planning/uirf/&quot;&gt;Urban Infrastructure Recovery Fund&lt;/a&gt;
package. This UIRF package, including the bike network was also vetted and approved
by the City of Columbus. The full route map was available at that time and was examined
and approved by all CAC commissioners and city officials involved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In September 2017 The CAC received an additional update on all UIRF projects, including
the Clintonville Bikeway network. Once again, all CAC members had a chance to review the route
map and design. The CAC re-affirmed their approval at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were articles about the Clintonville bike network in both
&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20150825074636/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/08/24/bike-n-hike-safety.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Columbus Dispatch&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.columbusunderground.com/clintonville-greenways-idea-moving-forward-bw1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Columbus Underground&lt;/a&gt;.
The Dispatch article included the route map showing the Beechwold Connector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Clintonville Resident Libby Wetherholt is Hooked on Clintonville's Neighborhood Greenways</title>
    <link href="https://clintonvillegreenways.org/2022/03/06/libby-wetherholt.html"/>

    <updated>2022-02-20T12:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://clintonvillegreenways.org/2022/03/06/libby-wetherholt</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have served as an interested citizen on the Clintonville Area Commission Planning
and Development Committee for over 10 years. It’s been a fun experience. I’ve learned
so many things about city development and about how to effect change in a city. I’ve
also been continually challenged by the really talented folks who give of their time
and professional expertise to our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;full rounded shadow&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the topic of a neighborhood bikeway/greenway was introduced at one of our meetings
about 5 years ago, I have to admit I was a little lukewarm about it. After all, I am a
woman “of a certain age” who hadn’t been on a bicycle for years.  But as I learned about the goals of the bikeway, I became intrigued.  I started thinking about my days of growing up in Bexley bicycling all around the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;full rounded shadow&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/libby/libbys-bike-with-basket.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Libby's Bike with Basket. Photo: Libby Wetherholt&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the completion of the first part of the bikeway, CAC held an introductory group ride
that was really FUN. Now there were marked streets to show the recommended, safer routes
for those of us who just like to “tool” around on our bikes and perhaps do a couple of
errands. The bikeway was designed to show riders routes where the traffic is less busy,
where crossing some of our busier streets is safer, and where families and individuals
could actually find their way to stores, libraries, coffee shops, and maybe even friends’
houses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;full rounded shadow&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/libby/deer-in-walhalla-ravine.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Deer in Walhalla Ravine. Photo: Libby Wetherholt&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hooked! On my high energy days I truly enjoy getting out on my bike, pedaling through
the neighborhood, maybe going to a meeting at Clintonville Woman’s Club, or picking up a
loaf of bread at the store. Many of the times I’m out I might be the only rider on these
less traveled streets. Sometimes I’ll connect to the Olentangy Trail and go clear up to
Broadmeadows. This bikeway has been a great added amenity to Clintonville and, again, we
have led the way for other parts of the city to begin thinking about this type of path for
their part of town.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A component of the Clintonville Neighborhood Greenway is a shared use path that connects
Rathbone Ave to Jeffrey Place. The path will be constructed on city parkland. Here’s a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1hsT6lhfuUlh2AUk1Lp9lDTgUFNs&amp;amp;ll=40.06238694099186%2C-83.02532179556246&amp;amp;z=17&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; of the location and here’s a
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/connectors/rathbone-jeffrey-place-connector.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;drawing&lt;/a&gt;
of what it will look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this may seem unusual, shared use paths are used throughout Columbus to connect
neighborhoods to each other and to nearby trail systems. These connections make the neighborhoods
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brucefreemanrailtrail.org/pdf/LA-Metro-Bike-paths-safety-property-values.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
safer and more desireable to live in.
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neighborhoods are safer because there are more “eyes on the street”. More
people that live in the neighborhood are out and about and are more likely to see
and report suspicious activity. The neighborhoods are more desireable because people
have more options to move safely around their community. They have more “random
encounters” with other people, resulting in increased feelings of belonging and
wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Winter 2016 Progress Update</title>
    <link href="https://clintonvillegreenways.org/2016/01/08/winter-2016-progress-update.html"/>
    <published>2016-01-08T00:00:00-05:00</published>
    <updated>2016-01-08T12:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://clintonvillegreenways.org/2016/01/08/winter-2016-progress-update</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We’ve met several times with the city over the last 6 months to discuss the Neighborhood Greenways
route and design. While many of the &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/08/phase-1-route-and-design.html&quot;&gt;design recommendations we made for phase 1&lt;/a&gt;
may seem simple (such as painting green-backed sharrows on the road), they require exemptions from
the strict rules that determine what types of pavement markings and signs can be used on public roads.
However, to achieve the safety level of a true neighborhood greenway, we need to use the
latest design elements. Many other cities are already constructing street networks using these newer
design elements. If we don’t match their innovations in Columbus, we risk getting left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the city understands the importance of building a safe neighborhood greenway network.
By incorporating advice from the city bike coordinator and local advocates, the city is looking for
ways to improve on designs that they’ve used in the past. The goal is to make Clintonville Neighborhood
Greenways a model street network that will serve as a template for neighborhoods throughout Columbus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;join-our-volunteer-teams&quot;&gt;Join our volunteer teams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, we’re creating teams to take on specific tasks as we move closer to
building the greenways. In the months to come, we’ll be working on outreach to Clintonville
residents, businesses, schools, and other interested parties to get the word out about the
coming neighborhood greenways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are creating teams for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Branding and marketing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Community outreach&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grants and fundraising&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Legal and Business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in pitching in as a volunteer, please sign up here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17w5HG4pIi6R9qV0zsFzMHERkVXj2713ZYTg59iF8q6Y/viewform?usp=send_form&quot;&gt;Clintonville Neighborhood Greenway Signup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;were-working-towards-501c3-status&quot;&gt;We’re working towards 501(c)(3) status&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our application for 501(c)(3) status is coming along. Status as a tax-exempt organization
will make advocacy and raising money easier. We’re fortunate to already have several experienced
grant writers who will be helping us raise money to further our goals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Phase 1 Route and Design</title>
    <link href="https://clintonvillegreenways.org/2015/05/08/phase-1-route-and-design.html"/>
    <published>2015-05-08T00:00:00-04:00</published>
    <updated>2015-09-11T12:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://clintonvillegreenways.org/2015/05/08/phase-1-route-and-design</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Phase 1 of the Clintonville Neighborhood Greenways has been funded! We are in the process
of working on a detailed route and design with the City of Columbus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a working document outlining our recommendations for Phase 1 of the Clintonville
Neighborhood Greenways. It’s intended to be a starting point for the detailed designs that
will be developed by the City of Columbus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;strategy&quot;&gt;Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our strategy for building the Neighborhood Greenways is to start with the minimal
infrastructure that achieves our design goals (known in the tech world as a “minimal
viable product”). We will then monitor the success of the Neighborhood Greenways and
evolve and improve the design as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, the minimal viable product is a network of neighborhood roads that feel safe for
all ages and abilities. This boils down to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Traffic speed under 25mph&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Traffic volume less than 1000 cars/day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People feel relaxed and safe biking and walking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these metrics can be measured, recorded, and tracked over time. If we meet our goals, no
additional treatments are needed. If we don’t meet our goals then additional treatments can
be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;general-design-guidelines&quot;&gt;General Design Guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neighborhood greenways consist of the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A distinctive look&lt;/strong&gt; so that all road users are aware of the neighborhood greenway.
People driving are alerted that the street is prioritized for biking and walking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatments to reduce vehicle speed and volume as needed.&lt;/strong&gt; The goal is to keep speed
under 25mph and ADT under 1000 cars per day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved treatments at busy intersections&lt;/strong&gt; to help people biking and walking cross more easily.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free-flow travel for people biking and walking&lt;/strong&gt; by assigning the right-of-way to the
neighborhood greenway at intersections wherever possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Way-finding signs&lt;/strong&gt; guiding people along the route and letting them know what is
nearby, for example parks, schools, and local businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;route-and-design-recommendations&quot;&gt;Route and design recommendations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Phase 1 route was chosen to connect to all parts of Clintonville while remaining easy to
implement. Wherever possible, we chose streets that already met our goals for Neighborhood
Greenways so that minimal changes will be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;map_container full&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a class=&quot;overlay&quot; href=&quot;https://mapsengine.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zEAPhiHiDgA8.kIVN6G1UPcLo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://mapsengine.google.com/map/u/0/embed?mid=zEAPhiHiDgA8.kIVN6G1UPcLo&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;calumet-street&quot;&gt;Calumet Street&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calumet Street &lt;span class=&quot;muted smaller&quot;&gt;(‘A’ on map)&lt;/span&gt; is the biggest challenge on the
Neighborhood Greenways route. Traffic volume is 2200 cars/day - twice what we would like. 85th
percentile speed is 33mph in some places - well above our goal of 25mph. Because of the windy
nature of the road and higher traffic volumes, unsafe passes are common, making this road
unsuitable in it’s current condition for families and other risk-averse people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calumet is a neighborhood collector, which means traffic restrictions will be difficult. Because
on-street parking is widely used, especially south of Weber, we cannot make room for bike lanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Visually narrow road.&lt;/b&gt; The wider sections of Calumet lead to faster speeds. One option
is to stripe out an 8’ parking lane. Also evaluate for green infrastructure such as curb bump
outs in coordination with Columbus Blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remove yellow center line.&lt;/b&gt; A yellow center line encourages higher speeds and more
dangerous passing behavior. Use short sections of yellow center lines only at major intersections
(Arcadia, Weber, Broadway) and around blind curves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use more frequent sharrows.&lt;/b&gt; More frequent sharrows are advised for roads with higher
traffic volume and speed. Consider sharrows at 75 to 100 foot intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Add “Bikes may use full lane” signs.&lt;/b&gt; These signs are the recommended standard for
clarifying that bikes are allowed full use of the road. “Share the road” signs should not
be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full rounded shadow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/phase-1/calumet.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intersection-of-torrence-road-and-high-street&quot;&gt;Intersection of Torrence Road and High Street&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traffic at this intersection &lt;span class=&quot;muted smaller&quot;&gt;(‘B’ on map)&lt;/span&gt; increased
significantly after the new Starbucks opened. Although drivers are fairly cautious and aware
of people biking and walking, the large volume of cars can make navigating this intersection
tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Add ladder-style crosswalks&lt;/b&gt;. More prominent crosswalks will highlight the Neighborhood
Greenways crossing, raise awareness of the increased bike and pedestrian traffic, and make
people walking and biking feel more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intersection-of-milton-northmoor-and-montrose-way&quot;&gt;Intersection of Milton, Northmoor, and Montrose Way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 6-way intersection &lt;span class=&quot;muted smaller&quot;&gt;(‘C’ on map)&lt;/span&gt; is large and has numerous
conflict points. While traffic volume is generally low, it can still be tricky to navigate with bikes,
cars and pedestrians all using the same space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Add a planted traffic circle.&lt;/b&gt; Traffic entering the circle yields to traffic that’s already in
the circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full rounded shadow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/phase-1/six-way.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intersection-of-milton-and-hollenback&quot;&gt;Intersection of Milton and Hollenback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This intersection &lt;span class=&quot;muted smaller&quot;&gt;(‘D’ on map)&lt;/span&gt; is difficult to navigate because
it’s offset with the exit from the library. Traffic is generally slow and people navigate cautiously.
The most common conflict is between people turning left from Milton onto Hollenback and people exiting
the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term this intersection should be re-aligned with the library exit and converted to a 4-way stop.
For Phase 1 &lt;b&gt;consider adding additional sharrows through the turn&lt;/b&gt; to highlight the presence of bikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full rounded shadow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/phase-1/intersection-of-milton-and-hollenback.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hollenback&quot;&gt;Hollenback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hollenback &lt;span class=&quot;muted smaller&quot;&gt;(‘E’ on map)&lt;/span&gt; is a park road. Traffic volume is sometimes
high, especially on evenings with children’s soccer. However speeds are low and people are alert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a side path that parallels Hollenback. This path is narrow and the surface is
uneven. There are several conflict points where the path crosses driveways. Getting on and
off the path also requires crossing traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some people may choose to use the side path, the Neighborhood Greenways route should use
Hollenback and should be marked with sharrows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full rounded shadow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/phase-1/hollenback-road.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shelter-house-parking-lot&quot;&gt;Shelter house parking lot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route past the shelter house parking lot &lt;span class=&quot;muted smaller&quot;&gt;(‘F’ on map)&lt;/span&gt;
is confusing. It appears the road goes straight into the parking lot. There are two parking
lot exits with stop signs, but because of the curvy nature of the road, it’s not clear who has
the right of way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use sharrows and a white edge line to define the travel lane.&lt;/b&gt; Add stop bars at parking
lot exits to clarify right of way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full rounded shadow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/phase-1/shelter-house-parking-lot.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exit-to-olentangy-blvd&quot;&gt;Exit to Olentangy Blvd&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace gate with bollards, allowing people biking to pass through, or add a new bike
exit following the desired direction of travel &lt;span class=&quot;muted smaller&quot;&gt;(‘G’ on map)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full rounded shadow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/phase-1/exit-to-olentangy.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intersection-of-olentangy-blvd-and-henderson-road&quot;&gt;Intersection of Olentangy Blvd and Henderson Road&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The light cycle at this intersection &lt;span class=&quot;muted smaller&quot;&gt;(‘H’ on map)&lt;/span&gt; is very long.
This adds significant delay to trips on the Neighborhood Greenways route. It also causes a large
number of cars to queue up on Olentangy Blvd during rush hour. &lt;b&gt;Evaluate shortening the light
cycle&lt;/b&gt; to reduce delay for Neighborhood Greenways traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a problem with drivers bullying people on bikes at this intersection. Drivers that
want to turn right don’t like waiting behind bikes that are going straight and sometimes honk
and yell at them to “get out of the road”. Bikes often go up on the sidewalk ramps to wait
which causes problems at they re-integrate into the traffic flow when the light changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evaluate the intersection for bike boxes&lt;/b&gt;. Bike boxes would create space for bikes
and would clearly communicate that people on bikes should wait in the road and not on the
sidewalk ramps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Add ladder-style crosswalks&lt;/b&gt;. More prominent crosswalks will highlight the Neighborhood
Greenways crossing, raise awareness of the increased bike and pedestrian traffic, and make
people walking and biking feel more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;weisheimer&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intersection-of-weisheimer-road-and-high-street&quot;&gt;Intersection of Weisheimer Road and High Street&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This intersection is offset &lt;span class=&quot;muted smaller&quot;&gt;(‘I’ on map)&lt;/span&gt;. However, since there
is a 4-way traffic signal, it would be possible to &lt;b&gt;re-align the intersection for bikes&lt;/b&gt;. This
could be done by converting one of the bank exit lanes to a two-way bike lane, or by adding a two-way
bike lane to the north of the bank exit. The north-east corner of Weisheimer and High is being
redeveloped, so this is a perfect opportunity to start the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second option would be to &lt;b&gt;improve the sidewalk on the east side of High Street&lt;/b&gt; and route
bikes along the sidewalk in front of the business. This creates a conflict point with cars
turning from High Street onto E. Weisheimer Road. The conflict could be eliminated with a choker
entrance preventing turns onto E. Weisheimer Rd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case &lt;b&gt;add ladder-style crosswalks&lt;/b&gt;. More prominent crosswalks will highlight the Neighborhood
Greenway crossing and make people walking and biking feel more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Green sharrow&lt;/b&gt; - use on roads with higher volume to emphasize shared use lanes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gateway sharrow&lt;/b&gt; - use one gateway sharrow after each major intersection to alert road
users to the presence of the Neighborhood Greenways.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sharrow flower&lt;/b&gt; - use to mark intersections of Neighborhood Greenways routes to alert
people that they have a choice to make.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;traffic-volume-targets&quot;&gt;Traffic volume targets&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on guidance from engineers in Portland, we feel that targeting traffic volumes of under
1000 cars/day is essential to making a neighborhood greenway safe enough for all ages
and abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the guidelines that Portland is proposing to become official policy for their
neighborhood greenways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1,000 autos per day is the desired maximum.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1,500+ autos per day is acceptable, but diversion is considered on a case by case basis and
recommended if there is an expectation that other changes, or the greenway’s location, will attract
significant traffic to the project street.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More than 2,000 autos per day necessitates diversion in some form if the neighborhood greenway
street is to be a shared space with auto traffic. This is primarily because Portland has a desired
maximum speed of 20 mph, and state law permits us to reduce the residential statutory speed of 25
mph by 5 mph on greenway streets, but only if the residential street has less than 2,000 autos per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guidance is based in part on research documented in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://transweb.sjsu.edu/PDFs/research/1005-low-stress-bicycling-network-connectivity.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Low-Stress Bicycling and Network Connectivity&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portland OR and Berkeley CA both have successful neighborhood greenway networks. For reference
their neighborhood greenway design guidelines are linked below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Bike Parking in Clintonville</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the major obstacles to a more bike-infused lifestyle is a lack of designated parking near
restaurants, stores, salons, and other favorite businesses. Leaving your bike chained to a parking
meter, tree, or fence is risky (not to mention, unsightly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designated bike parking gives people a safe and convenient place to park their bike. Because bike racks
take up little space, people can ride right up to the front door and have a safe place to lock up their
bicycles. This encourages more people to bike which reduces traffic congestion and parking hassles for
people that arrive by car. Everyone benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full rounded shadow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bike-parking/bike-parking-in-clintonville.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Clintonville Neighborhood Greenways is working with local businesses and the City of Columbus to add
more bike parking in Clintonville. We are sending volunteers to local businesses to show them how
easy it is to request a free bike rack from the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run a business in Clintonville and we haven’t visited you yet, requesting a free bike rack
from the city is easy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Call the City of Columbus (614)645-3111 and request a bicycle rack&lt;/b&gt;. They will ask you for
the address where you are requesting to have a rack installed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Infrastructure Management will follow-up on your request&lt;/b&gt;. Check your mail and phone messages for
any possible follow-up questions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notify the owner of the property at the address where you are requesting a rack.&lt;/b&gt; They may need to
approve the request before Infrastructure Management can proceed with the installation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome customers on bikes to park in front of your business!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
